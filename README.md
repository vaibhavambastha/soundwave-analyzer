# SoundWave Analysis Program

Developed a Java-based program for performing comprehensive sound wave analysis and manipulation. This program supports a range of operations on audio files (MP3 and WAV), including waveform transformations, filtering, and structural comparison, with visualizations powered by Java Swing for an interactive user experience.


## Features

### Basic Operations
- **Waveform Transformation**: Transform audio into sinusoidal, square, and triangle waveforms.
- **Echo Addition**: Add echoes to enhance sound depth and texture.
- **High-Pass Filter**: Filter out low-frequency noise, clarifying higher frequency components.

### Advanced Analysis
- **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**: Perform DFT to analyze frequency components and transform sound waves into the frequency domain.
- **Waveform Comparison**: Compare two sound waves to assess structural similarity and group music by similarity.
- **Visualization**: Real-time waveform visualizations using Java Swing for interactive analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language for functionality and operations.
- **Swing**: Java GUI library for visualizing waveforms and providing user interaction.
- **Audio Formats**: Supports both MP3 and WAV file analysis.
